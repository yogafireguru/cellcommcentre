Welcome to the CommunityPlatform To Collaborate With Cells !
We are building a new platform to help unite people and contribute to UN SDG Agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity,and peace and justice. The Goals interconnect and in order to leave no one behind, it √≠s important that we achieve each Goal and target by 2030.

This is a platform to connect, educate and empower our global community to solve greatest challenges. Together as part of cell network. Its world first open source scalable platform which brings everyone working on UN SDG on a single platform aligned to a commom framework. Check out more at www.yogafire.guru/solution

## üëÄ &nbsp; Why Cell Network

For the past 1 year we‚Äôve explored solutions from all over the world on open hardware and software projects to tackle some of the most pressing issues, building machines and tools to fix the mess. The more we know about these projects, the more we realised that there are two main hurdles to achieving of UN SDG projects.

- A project's success is closely linked to its community, and for a new project starting up, finding and creating their own strong community is often a time-consuming activity that can take lots of resources.
- While working on a project we often find ourselves having to use a multitude of digital tools that are often incomplete, disconnected, privately owned and not open source.
- Solution exists but people don't know about it and can't use those
- Its a 4 Step process which we have outlined

At YogaFire we aim to tackle these problems holistically by following a standard 4 stage process powered by a strong unified community for the different projects under its umbrella and offering the necessary tools to collaborate and connect in one single place. Free and opensource.

4 Steps are

1) Awareness
2) Build Skills
3) Community Network (This platform is enabler for this Step)
4) Cell Network

## ‚ö°Ô∏è &nbsp; What is Cell Network

The cell network helps people to connect and collaborate on UN SDG projects in one single place. A place where people can meet, help each other, ask and answer questions, share their innovative ways of fixing problems, discover people around them, connect locally, find events and more. Cell community platform aims to provide the tools to connect both online and offline. Amongst other features we have Newsfeed, How-to, Q&A, Discussion, Events,Discover, Maps and more.

## üëê Open Source

Society and the environment are kind of screwed üí© in many ways. We think free knowledge and open source are the fastest and most efficient ways to bring about innovation to tackle some of the most pressing humanity‚Äôs fuck ups. Simple.
