Welcome to the CommunityPlatform To Collaborate With Cells !
We are building a new platform to help unite people and contribute to UN SDG Agenda. The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges we face, including those related to poverty, inequality, climate, environmental degradation, prosperity,and peace and justice. The Goals interconnect and in order to leave no one behind, it √≠s important that we achieve each Goal and target by 2030.

This is a platform to connect, educate and empower our global community to solve greatest challenges. Together as part of cell network. Its world first open source scalable platform which brings everyone working on UN SDG on a single platform aligned to a commom framework. Check out more at www.yogafire.guru/solution

## üëÄ &nbsp; Why Cell Network

For the past 1.5 year we‚Äôve explored solutions from all over the world on open hardware and software projects to tackle some of the most pressing issues. The more we know about these projects, the more we realised that there are various main hurdles to achieving of UN SDG projects.

Basically we have diagonsed it as 4 stage process

1) Awareness
- Lack of awareness of UN SDG, How many people know what would be the impact of 1.5 Degree increase in earth temperature and how anyone can contribute in it
2) Build Skills
- Solution exists but normal people don't know about it and can't use those. So we are open sourcing these skills
3) Community Network (This platform is enabler for this Step)
- A project's success is closely linked to its community, and for a new project starting up, finding and creating their own strong community is often a time-consuming activity that can take lots of resources.
- While working on a project we often find ourselves having to use a multitude of digital tools that are often incomplete, disconnected, privately owned and not open source.
4) Cell Network
- Once step 1,2 and 3 are complete it gives us a platform to create a circular economical model and giving power to 98% of population who are unable to do anything today


At YogaFire we aim to tackle these problems holistically by following a standard 4 stage process powered by a strong unified community for the different projects under its umbrella and offering the necessary tools to collaborate and connect in one single place. Free and opensource.

Society and the environment are kind of screwed üí© in many ways. We think free knowledge and open source are the fastest and most efficient ways to bring about innovation to tackle some of the most pressing humanity‚Äôs fuck ups. Simple.
